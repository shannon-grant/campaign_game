Fix Charitable Campaigns so it doesn't just point out a bunch of games

Menu Options
1. We load up the game. We need a load screen.
2. After load screen, a login screen asks the user for Username and password. (You can create if it doesn’t exist). -- This def login is in CLI (C)
3. If the password doesn’t match you’re prompted to enter it again or create a new account - prompt.mask
4. Once logged in you’ll have four options
    1. Play a game  (U)
    2. See your account balance  -- Done  (R)
    3. See what campaigns you've contributed to -- Done (R) 
    4. Delete Account (D) -- Done 
    “You’ve chosen to play for this cause! Good choice!” 
    “You’ll be playing a game with x amount of rounds. At the end of each round you can choose to stop or keep playing” 



We need: 
C -- A def login method that creates a user with a password and account balance
    Or that just logs the user in
    - Create new game
R -- both methods created we just need the def login_choices method 
U -- Play game method 
    - change Username/password
    - up to 2 wrong, game over  (create wrong_count variable)
    - if game won, increment account_balance by 5% if easy, 10% if medium, 15% if hard
        -off reward, 
    - if game lost, decrease account_balance by 15% if easy, 10% if medium, 5% if hard 
    - Will need to include a breakif wrong_count = 2
    - 6 rounds 
    - Method 
    - winnings variable to keep track   
D -- Delete Account method -- Done


We need to create a def login_choices with these four options 
    that route to the different methods
